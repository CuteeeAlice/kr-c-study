# Alice’s GitHub Guide 🐱💻

📁 Folder names such as `01-*****`, `02-*****`, etc.  
represent the order of examples I created while learning C.

🔄 Inside each folder, the same example will be continuously improved,  
with new versions added as `ver.1`, `ver.2`, and so on.

🌱 The shared examples are beginner-level code,  
and may be freely used for both public and commercial purposes.

🏷️ Credit is appreciated,  
but not required. (I’m a bit shy.. 🙈)

🙇‍♀️ Thank you very much for taking the time to read this. (_ _)
