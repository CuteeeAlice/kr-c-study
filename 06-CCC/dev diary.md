This project started as a CCC (Cute Cat Cafe) simulator, but the world kind of expanded on its own…!!

At first, everything happened only inside the cafe. While walking around, I kept thinking, “I want to go outside too.”
That thought led me to create the outside world (WORLD). And once there was an outside, it felt like there should be an inside as well, so I ended up making a home (HOME).

As I kept adding things, trying to implement everything within the cafe project became really complicated.
So I asked GPT whether it was possible to structure one project using multiple sub-projects. After learning that it was doable, I started building things step by step while learning along the way.

Compared to the cafe, the other areas don’t have as much detail yet!ㅠㅠ
I’m planning to slowly update and improve them little by little whenever I get new ideas.
